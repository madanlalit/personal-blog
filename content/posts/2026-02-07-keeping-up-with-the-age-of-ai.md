## The Pace Problem

New model dropped. New framework announced. New tool you've never heard of is suddenly "essential."

The speed at which AI is evolving is unprecedented. If you have a 9-to-5 job, keeping up feels nearly impossible. Even if you dedicated yourself to learning something new every day, you'd still fall behind.

I suspect this is true for most of us—and soon, it will become the norm.

But here's the thing: **it's okay to not know everything.**

## What Actually Matters

Here's the counterintuitive truth: not chasing every new thing is a *feature*, not a bug.

If you can reverse-engineer problems and understand the underlying principles, you can adapt to new tools and frameworks in no time. The fundamentals are the leverage point—everything else is just a different interface to the same ideas.

## The Learning Strategy

The best way to learn is to get hands-on with the best tools available. A few worth exploring:

- **Codex** and **Claude Code** for AI-assisted development
- **OpenClaw** and **BrowserUse** for agent-based automation

Deep dive into these tools. Use an LLM to help you reverse-engineer how they work. Document what you learn. Then build your own lightweight version—that's where real understanding happens.

One more thing I believe is absolutely necessary: **dedicate at least one day a week to coding without AI.** No Copilot, no Claude, no autocomplete. Search for things manually. Read the docs. Struggle a little.

You don't need to write 1,000 lines of code—200 is plenty. Focus on understanding the core concepts and logic. That's how you build the foundation that makes everything else click. 

## Mindset Shifts

A few mental models that have helped me:

**1. Embrace being perpetually outdated.** The moment you accept that you'll never "catch up," you stop feeling behind. You're not behind—you're just choosing what to focus on.

**2. Think in layers, not tools.** Every AI tool is built on the same layers: prompting, context management, tool use, memory, and feedback loops. Learn the layers once, and you can navigate any tool.

**3. Learn in public.** Write about what you're learning. Build small projects. Share your confusion. This creates accountability and compounds over time. Your documentation today becomes someone else's shortcut tomorrow.

**4. Bet on taste, not speed.** AI can generate code faster than you can type. But it can't tell you what's worth building. Your judgment, intuition, and sense of quality are your moat.

## Practical Tactics

Here's what actually works for me:

- **Weekly "fundamentals day"**: One day a week, no AI. Just docs, Stack Overflow, and your own brain. This keeps your core skills sharp.

- **Build micro-clones**: Pick a tool you admire. Spend a weekend building a stripped-down version. You'll learn more in 48 hours than weeks of tutorials.

- **Maintain a "reverse-engineering journal"**: When you encounter something interesting, write down how you think it works. Then verify. This builds pattern recognition.

- **Follow builders, not influencers**: Find 3-5 people shipping real things with AI. Study their work, not their tweets. A few worth following: [Dexter Horthy](https://x.com/dexhorthy), [Lance Martin](https://x.com/RLanceMartin), and [Simon Willison](https://x.com/simonw).

- **Set learning sprints**: Dedicate 2-3 weeks to go deep on one thing, then move on. Depth beats breadth when time is limited.

## The Human Edge

Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI is getting better at everything you can *measure*. Speed. Accuracy. Consistency. Coverage.

But there are things AI still can't touch:

- **Knowing what problem to solve.** AI can generate solutions all day. Knowing which problems are worth solving—that's human.
- **Taste and judgment.** Recognizing when something feels right, even when the metrics don't capture it.
- **Context that isn't in the prompt.** Your organization's unwritten rules. Your team's dynamics. The thing the customer actually meant.
- **Taking responsibility.** When things go wrong, someone needs to own the decision. That's you.

The engineers who thrive won't be the ones who can prompt the best. They'll be the ones who know what to ask for—and what to throw away.

The age of AI isn't about keeping up. It's about knowing when to run, when to walk, and when to stand still. Master the fundamentals. Trust your judgment. And remember: the goal isn't to know everything. It's to build something that matters.
